### This projects aim is to create Podpreset which contains multiple enviromental resources(configmaps,volumes,secrets etc) and inject them in labeled(can be either 0 or infinite) pods at once.

-   The rule is the same as secrets and configs, which the podpresets should be defined before pods/deployments.
